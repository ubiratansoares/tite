Tite is a simple DSL on top of existing RxJava2 testing APIs. This DSL proposes a nice way to perform assertions, while leveraging 100% on existing testing machinery of current RxJava.

## Overview

Powered by Tite, tests for your RxJava-based APIs will look like this

```kotlin

val words = Observable.just("Adenor", "Leonardo", "Bacchi")

given(words) {

    beforeChecksAwait {
        countingTime until 3.seconds
    }

    assertThatSequence {
        should be completed
        should be terminated
        should notBe broken
        should be subscribed
    }

    verifyForEmissions {
        items match sequenceOf("Adenor", "Leonardo", "Bacchi")
        firstItem shouldBe "Adenor"
        never emmits "Parreira"
        never emmits "FelipÃ£o"
    }
    
    verifyWhenError {
        fails byError NumberFormatException
        fails withErrorMessage "exception msg"
        fails byType FileAlreadyExistsException::class
        fails byMatching { it -> it == CredentialsAccessError }
    }
}

```

instead of this

```kotlin

val words = Observable.just("Adenor", "Leonardo", "Bacchi")

words.test()
    .assertComplete()
    .assertTerminated()
    .assertNoErrors()
    .assertValueSequence(listOf("Adenor", "Leonardo", "Bacchi"))
    // ... more verifications
    
```

Don't get me wrong here : fluent, chainable API style is quite great for Java ... but we can do better with Kotlin! 

## Quick Setup

Grab this dependency to your Gradle project using [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io) 

For Android projects

```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.ubiratansoares:tite:<latest_version>'
}
```

For non-Android Gradle projects

```
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.ubiratansoares:tite:<latest_version>'
}
```

Current version of this library (`0.1.1`) matches

- Kotlin `1.3.11`
- RxJava `2.2.4`
